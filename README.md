# Exploring Streaming Architecture with Scala

This is the companion code repository for the [Exploring Streaming Architecture](https://leanpub.com/exploring-streaming-architecture) ebook I'm currently writing.

## Staring point

The `starting-point` tag marks the initial state of a model application that will be used throughout the book. It is loosely based on the sample application built during the course of [Modern Web Development with Scala](https://leanpub.com/modern-web-development-with-scala). 

## Versions used

The code uses Play 2.5 and Scala 2.11.8 along with sbt 0.13.11.
